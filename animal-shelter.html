      <p>Barney is a large purple dinosaur. During the 90's he was joyful, fun and loving. After Y2K he had a spiral downhill and looked for answers at the bottom of a liquor bottle. He never found them but he found us. He is a new dinosaur and would love to find a new home!</p>

      <p>Perry came to us from all the way down under! For those of you who may not know he is a duck-billed, beaver-tailed, otter-footed mammal. He is venomous but if you stay on his good side, he's got your back!</p>

      <h1>Charmander</h1>
      <img src="img/Charmander.png" alt="charmander">
      <p>Charmander will live forever! He can evolve, but never dies. You will need to include him in your will. Due to his eternal flame on his tail, we highly recommend a smoker adopts him! The money saved on lost lighters will result in a positive investment.</p>

      <p>Smeagol was once a fun loving hobbit. He took a wrong turn in life when he became obbssesed with a gold ring. Some confuse him with a gold digger, but in fact he is just a incredibly loyal.</p>
